### theITHollow Kubernetes Guide

This repository includes the code samples from the [Getting Started With Kubernetes ](https://theithollow.com/2019/01/26/getting-started-with-kubernetes/) blog posts from [theITHollow](theithollow.com).

Each of the folders starting with a number, correspond with one of the blog posts in the list.

Also included within this repo is the application used in the examples.

The blog posts in the series should provide a good jump start in to using Kubernetes and the code samples will provide useful hands on with the concepts. 

NOTE: In order to follow the guide, you will need to have a Kubernetes cluster installed, that has integration with a cloud provider such as vSphere, AWS, GCP, etc. The examples shown require things such as Load Balancers, and elastic storage to fully follow the guide.
